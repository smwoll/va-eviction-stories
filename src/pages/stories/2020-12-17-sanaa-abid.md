I’m Sanaa Abid I am a single mother of 3 kids ages 10, 8, and 5. I live in Southern Towers Sherwood Building. At the start of the pandemic I was working at home depot when the coronavirus virus hit our country and the world ...and because I did not have anyone to take care of my kids and I had to stop working and stay home with my kids. I applied for unemployment, but after thousands of phone calls my claim is still pending and I did not receive a penny. I'm surviving thanks to the help of my friends with the minimum right now, and didn't pay my rent for 4 months. I tried to apply for Affordable housing or Emergency Section 8 but still no response. I received the Unemployment PUA because I got disqualified for the regular one but they approved me for the PUA but I received it twice & that was it now I need to do my weekly Claim but I don't have the access to do it...in last few weeks I received the two days notice so I applied for the Alexandria city assistance they help me but the problem is they didn't receive it when I called the city they said they need to find out what happened to that check so I received another 5 days notice again and now I'm working with the city again they working hard on my case and trying to find out where that check did go....so I don't know what to do I spoke to Ms. Cathy Johnson the Sherwood building manager she said she will find out about what's going on because she is new here but she is doing her best to help me out and try to find a solution for all these issues....hopefully I will receive food stamps otherwise I'll be done me & my kids.
