I am a single mother of four children, and I lost my job due to COVID-19. I have consistently been trying to apply for rental assistance in Loudoun County. The main barrier for me in receiving rental assistance has been my apartment complex. They don’t respond to me when I ask them for the documentation for the application, or they respond too late for me to complete the applications. Eventually, I was approved for a few months of rental assistance, but I am still behind on rent. It’s been extremely stressful for me. Since I still don’t have a consistent job, I’m leaving my apartment in Leesburg to look for somewhere with lower rent, in Purcellville or elsewhere. Tenants like me need to be protected from evictions, and our landlords need to be obligated to participate in rental assistance programs.
