Single mother with 2 minor children, her hours at work were lowered, 1-2 days a week, she did not arrive at the end of the month, her dues accumulated, she asked for assistance with the rent and they helped her with 2 months until July and August, I return to work 3 days a week and since then it has been a struggle to make ends meet. I must pay $ 1385 per 1 bedroom apartment. At the moment he is looking for help since he does not know how to pay for the month of December and beyond.
