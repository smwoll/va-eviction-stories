I'm a single mother of 3 children and I rent. I was infected with COVID and left without work. The months of backrent increased without having a way to pay. I applied for assistance and was approved after 3 months. It has been a challenge to pay rent with a check of $200 per week. I don't know what I will do next month. We need to track people who contract the virus, and we need to have income assistance until this disease is no more.
